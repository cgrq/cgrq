### Hi my name is Christian

I have seven years of technical and leadership experience in both IT and Marketing roles at a large tech company. I've had an interest in software development as an enthusiast for many years, and now am pursuing it as my career full time.

The three main projects I'm working on are: Loom, Smoke Signal, and Gather. 

Loom is an e-commerce site called Loom that allows users to sell products peer-to-peer. 

Smoke Signal is a chat app that utilizes web sockets (socket.io rooms) for real-time, persistent messaging channels that I built with three other amazing devs. 

Gather is a meet up site I developed a mini brand for and followed brand and motion animation guidelines for my component styling to align to. Check them out below!

Here are my live projects:
