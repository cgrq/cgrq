### Hi my name is Christian, but you can call me friend.

I have 7 years of technical and leadership experience in both IT and Marketing roles at a large tech company. I've had a passion for software development as an enthusiast for many years and recently put myself in the position to pursue it as my career full time. My favorite project I'm working on is an e-commerce site called Loom that allows users to sell products p2p. I also worked with three other incredible devs on a chat app that utilizes web sockets (rooms) for real-time, persistent chats.

I also love art and design. I have a creative side and was even paid to be creative leading corporate video at my previous org. My last boss, the Head of Corporate Brand who was a graphic designer for 20+ years, used to call me a "real designer". I'm highly proficient in both Adobe Illustrator and After Effects and have my Lottie animation workflow down for quick integration with React. 

I'm a quick study who is looking to make an impact right away and grow with the company I choose.

Here are my projects:
