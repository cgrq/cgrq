### Hi my name is Christian

I have seven years of technical and leadership experience in both IT and Marketing roles at a large tech company. I've had a passion for software development as an enthusiast for many years and now am pursuing it as my career full time. One project I'm working on is an e-commerce site called Loom that allows users to sell products peer-to-peer. 

I'm also working with three other incredible devs on a chat app called Smoke Signal that utilizes web sockets (rooms) for real-time, persistent messaging channels, and I decided to create a mini "brand" and built a meet up site called Gather following predefined brand and motion animation guidelines. Check them out below.

I have a passion for art and design as well. I have a creative side and was even paid to be creative leading corporate video at my previous org. My last boss, the Head of Corporate Brand who was a graphic designer for 15+ years, used to call me a "real designer". I'm highly proficient in both Adobe Illustrator and After Effects and have my Lottie animation workflow down for quick integration with React. 

I'm a quick study who is looking to make an impact right away and grow with the company I choose.

Here are my live projects:
