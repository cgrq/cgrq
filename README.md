### Hi my name is Christian

I have seven years of technical and leadership experience in both IT and Marketing roles at a large tech company. I've had an interest in software development as an enthusiast for many years and now am pursuing it as my career full time.

There are three main projects that I'm working on: Loom, Smoke Signal, and Gather. Loom is an e-commerce site called Loom that allows users to sell products peer-to-peer. I recently worked with three other incredible early devs on Smoke Signal, a chat app that utilizes web sockets (socket.io rooms) for real-time, persistent messaging channels. Gather is a meet up site that I developed a mini "brand" for and followed brand and motion animation guidelines for my component styling to align to. Check them out below!

I also have a passion for art and design. I have a creative side and was paid to be creative when I led Corporate Video at my previous org. My last boss, the Head of Corporate Brand who was a graphic designer for 15+ years, used to call me a "real designer". I'm highly proficient in Adobe Illustrator, After Effects, and have my Lottie animation workflow down for fast integration with React. 

I'm a detail oriented, creative team player/leader, and a quick study who is looking to make an impact in all endeavors.

Here are my live projects:
